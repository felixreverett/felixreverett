# 👋 Hello! I'm Felix
[Visit my website](https://frev.cc/folio)

> I’m currently learning **Scala**.

I’m a programmer and code enthusiast on a mission to make my dream projects a reality. I work most proficiently in C#, Go, Python, and JavaScript, and I also have experience in Scala, PHP, SQL, Assembly, and some Miranda.

If you want to learn more about me, I encourage you to check out my [website](https://frev.cc/folio) and [blog posts](https://frev.cc/folio-b).

## 🧠 I’m really into programming theory:
- What makes a good programming language?
  - I no longer believe there is a single best language waiting for me to find it, but the better languages do have recurring features. I’m on a journey to pinpoint what separates the wheat from the chaff, but to date I’ve found that the best languages strive to limit human error as much as possible, avoid boilerplate syntax, and don’t confine themselves to ‘one-way-only’ philosophy.
- Scala is the best programming language I've used to date. It recently dethroned Go thanks to its powerful functional-first syntax, and use of [method chaining](https://felixreverett.com/blog/method-chaining).
- Pointers are really just a cheeky way to turn value types into reference types.
- I fell in and out of love with recursion. Then I fell in love with it again. Exceeding the callstack was not a fun reality, and someone really should have told me about Tail Call Optimisation sooner.
- Memoization is powerful, has a fancy name, and is flat-out exciting.
 
## ⚡Some general facts about me:
- 💬 I speak three languages. I have an academic background in linguistics. I’m currently learning a couple more, too :)
- 🐈 My favourite animal is the cat.
- 🌳 The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is 7 June 2023.
