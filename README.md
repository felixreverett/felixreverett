## 🧠 My perspective on programming
- What makes a good programming language? Or rather, what makes one *feel* better than another?
  - I don’t believe there is a single best language waiting for me to find it, but the best languages do have recurring features. They strive to limit human error as much as possible and avoid boilerplate syntax. Mistakes in code should never be predictable.
- Go is the most fun programming language I've used to date. The community is wonderful, the packages are abundant, and most crucially **I enjoy writing it**. That being said, its lack of lambda functions is unfortunate. Even Python’s list comprehensions beat it.
- Pointers are just a cheeky way to turn value types into reference types.
- Recursion is exciting but exceeding the call stack is not. It should be avoided if a reasonable alternative can be implemented.
- Memoization is powerful, has a fancy name, and is flat-out exciting.
 
## ⚡Some general facts about me
- 💬 I speak three languages. I have an academic background in linguistics.
- 🐈 My favourite animal is the cat.
- 🌳 The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is 7 June 2023.
