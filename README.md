## ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Felix 

I'm a self-taught programmer with a goal to make my dream projects a reality. I mostly program in Go, C#, and JavaScript, with previous experience in Python and SQL.

## ðŸ§  The biggest lessons I've learnt in my (few) years programming
- What's the best programming language? Or rather, what makes one *feel* better than another?
  - I believe there is no best language, but the better languages limit human error as much as possible. Mistakes in code should be complex, not syntactic.
- Don't underestimate error logging at potential breakpoints in your code.
- Go is the most optimal programming language I've used to date. The community is wonderful, the packages are abundant, and most crucially **I enjoy writing it**.
- Pointers are just a cheeky way to turn value types into reference types.
- Recursion is not as good as you think it is. This is a note to my past self.
- Memoization is powerful, has a fancy name, and is flat-out exciting to implement.
 
## âš¡Some general facts about me
- ðŸ’¬ I speak three languages, four if you catch me on a good day.
- ðŸ“¦ OOP is no longer my preferred paradigm.
- ðŸŒ³ The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is 7 June 2023.
